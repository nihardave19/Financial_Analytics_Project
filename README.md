Explanation of Columns:
Count: Number of observations (daily returns) for each asset.
Mean: Average daily return.
Std Dev: Standard deviation of daily returns (a measure of volatility).
Min: Minimum daily return over the period.
25th Percentile: 25th percentile of daily returns.
Median: Median (50th percentile) daily return.
75th Percentile: 75th percentile of daily returns.
Max: Maximum daily return over the period.
Skew: Skewness, indicating asymmetry in the return distribution.
Kurtosis: Kurtosis, indicating the "tailedness" of the distribution (higher values imply more extreme values).


Explanation of Each Part:
Data Download: Retrieves the last three years of adjusted closing prices for each stock.
Returns Calculation: Calculates daily returns using percentage changes.
Descriptive Statistics: Provides comprehensive descriptive statistics for each asset, including skewness and kurtosis.
Visualization:
Price & Returns Histogram: Plots the time series of closing prices and histograms for daily returns for each asset.
Correlation Heatmap: Displays a heatmap for the correlation matrix, with color coding for easy interpretation.




Explanation of the Code:
Portfolio Performance Calculation: The portfolio_performance function calculates the annualized return and risk (standard deviation) of a portfolio given a set of weights.

Random Portfolios for Efficient Frontier: We generate 5,000 random portfolios and calculate their returns, risks, and Sharpe ratios. These are used to plot the efficient frontier.

Maximum Sharpe Portfolio (Market Portfolio): We identify the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which we assume to be the market portfolio.

Capital Market Line (CML): The CML is plotted from the risk-free rate to the market portfolio.

Security Market Line (SML): Using the market portfolio as the benchmark, we calculate the beta and expected return of RELIANCE.NS and plot it on the SML.

Output:
Efficient Frontier and CML Plot: Shows the Markowitz curve with the CML extending from the risk-free rate to the market portfolio.
SML Plot: Displays the Security Market Line, with the selected asset (RELIANCE.NS) plotted according to its beta and expected return.



Explanation:
Return: We calculate the weighted average return of the combined index, annualized by multiplying by 252 (the typical number of trading days in a year).

Risk: The portfolio's risk (volatility) is calculated using the covariance matrix of returns, scaled to annualized risk by multiplying by

Output:
The Combined Index Return is the weighted average annual return of all the assets in the portfolio.
The Combined Index Risk is the annualized standard deviation of the combined portfolioâ€™s returns, representing its volatility.
This will give you both the return and risk of your combined index, providing a summary of the risk-return profile of the synthetic portfolio you created.
